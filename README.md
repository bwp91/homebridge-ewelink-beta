# homebridge-ewelink-beta
There seems to be a variety of Homebridge plugins for eWeLink/Sonoff devices.
Ironically I have made another.
This package is basically a little project for myself that I am tinkering with.
But please feel free to give it a try - I can't assure you it's bug free!
If anyone wants to work with me on this then please do let me know.
Thanks

```bash
sudo npm i homebridge-ewelink-beta -g
```
