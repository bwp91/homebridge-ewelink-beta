# homebridge-ewelink-beta
This package is a fork from [homebridge-ewelink-max](https://github.com/howanghk/homebridge-ewelink) which I wanted to improve. It was a little project that I made for myself - hence the name beta in the title. I made so many code changes that a PR would have been out of the picture.

This package will eventually be deprecated.

I have released a new package which is much more stable and with a more appropriate name.

Please install my new package - [homebridge-ewelink-sonoff](https://github.com/thepotterfamily/homebridge-ewelink-sonoff).

Thanks,
Ben
